# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
This is a responsive Wishlist & Reviews web app built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
It lets users manage a personal wishlist, rate products with stars, and view submitted reviews.
The UI is clean, mobile-optimized, and fully component-based for easy maintenance.
Local state and mock data power the app for now, making it simple to expand later.
All code is modular, readable, and ready for backend integration or new features.
